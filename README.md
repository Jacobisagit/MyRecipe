### Preperation

The very first thing to do is put two cups of water on the boil.

Put then fillets aside let them sit for a second.

Dont turn the pan on just yet, the next thing to do is crush two garlic cloves. Throw these into the frying pan your now ready to put some heat on, a medium temperature is ideal.

### Cooking

9- Next turn your salmon on its final side to be cooked the top half let this cook untill you feel the salmon is done ideally 3-5 minutes should be enough. I personally like my salmon quite crispy and chared so i tend to leave it for a little longer. once done take out of pan place it onto a plate.
